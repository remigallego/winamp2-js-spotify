### Brainstorming
List of tracks can either be:
* Playlist
* Album
* Radio

And I chose to represent them with: 
explorer window with Windows XP assets

Folders: 
* Playlist
* Album
Winamp File (".mp3"?):
* Track

The explorer path can be used as the search bar
Artist ->   - Album 1: * Track 1
                       * Track 2
                       * Track 3
            - Album 2
            - etc..
